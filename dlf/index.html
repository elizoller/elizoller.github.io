						<h2>DSG: Supporting Digital Scholarship</h2>
						<img class="stretch" src="images/toolkitAlternatives.jpeg" style="border:none"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							We are part of the Digital Scholarship Group (DSG), which is a fairly new department in the library.
							<br/>
							We consider ourselves an applied research group, responsible for researching, developing, and supporting new avenues for digital scholarship at Northeastern.
							<br/>
							A primary goal for the DSG when it was first formed in 2013 was to find a way to support the various projects and research groups that needed to publish digital projects.
							<br/>
							Many of our researchers want a simple, customizable site to share project work, and they often look to Wordpress or Omeka to publish and share their content, neither of which is ideal for long term storage.
							<br/>
							Other projects turn to the library's Digital Repository Service to store and preserve content, which IS ideal for long term storage, but can't be customized for individual project needs.
							<br/>
							Some look to both the DRS for preservation and Wordpress or Omeka for publishing and sharing, duplicating their work across multiple systems.
							<br/>
							We wanted to create a tool that would satisfy the preservation AND presentation needs of a project by joining the DRS with customizable web publishing tools,
							<br/>
							How do you support project publishing and object storage at your institution?

							Planning for the DRS project toolkit started a year ago in October 2014 as a pilot project.
							<br/>
							We started with a project team of 4, and have expanded to a team of 10 today, including two developers and 4 research assistants.
							<br/>
							At the end of the 2015 pilot, 6 Northeastern projects will be using the Toolkit to present their materials.

						<h2>Goals</h2>

						<ul style="width:40%;float:right;font-size:70%">
							<li>Develop a lightweight and sustainable model for preserving and displaying/distributing project materials.</li>
							<li>Provide Northeastern projects with a low-barrier customized website to share project work.</li>
							<li>Support Northeastern projects by preserving project materials in the DRS.</li>
							<li>Encourage collaborative development between Toolkit sites.</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							In the beginning we had a four goals for the pilot:
							<br/>
							We wanted to create a sustainable and shareable digital project environment for scholars.
							<br/>
							We wanted to start a program that would scale, and we wanted to encourage project teams to become stewards of their own content, and empower them to customize and develop on their own.
							<br/>
							We wanted to avoid providing unique support for individual projects, but work with projects to create customizations that could be utilized by other projects.
							<br/>
							And we wanted to make sure that the project materials created were stored securely in the DRS, where the library could guarantee materials would be preserved.

							Before I dive into the details, let me give a brief overview of the DRS itself, since it is the foundation of the Toolkit.
							<br/>
							The DRS is a homegrown repository, which uses Fedora as the underlying storage architecture and Hydra for the interface.
							<br/>
							The interface is clean and focused and its main features are designed to support the widest possible range of material.

						<aside class="notes">
							Before we started work on the Hydra API that would feed DRS data to the Toolkit sites, we wanted to know precisely what functionality was needed to make a good digital project site.
							<br/>
							We met in December with representatives from a few DSG projects and partners, including representatives from:
							<ul>
								<li>the Our Marathon archive</li>
								<li>the Early Caribbean Digital Archive,</li>
								<li>University Archives and Special collections,</li>
								<li>students from public history who work a lot with digital project publishing.</li>
							</ul>
							We discussed what they, as digital scholars, need from an integrated digital publishing site like the one we were about to develop.
							<br/>
							We identified a few common needs from the group, including:
							<ul>
								<li>faceted searching,</li>
								<li>visualizations,</li>
								<li>sharing,</li>
								<li>downloading,</li>
								<li>and galleries or exhibits.</li>
							</ul>
							A few features were suggested during this meeting that were worth exploring in the future, but were out of scope for the pilot project, including:
							<ul>
								<li>two-way data syncing between the publishing tool and the DRS</li>
								<li>the ability to annotate files</li>
								<li>XML-aware searching.</li>
							</ul>
							We synthesized the outcomes of the stakeholder meeting into a list of features, which would become the first set of tools in the Toolkit.

							Now that we had a basic spec, we needed to decide what web publishing tools we were willing to support for the Toolkit.
							<br/>
							We originally planned on supporting Drupal, Omeka, and Wordpress, but quickly decided that Drupal would be too cumbersome.
							<br/>
							Omeka is very popular with digital scholars but we realized that there were few advantages to supporting both Omeka and Wordpress as part of the Toolkit infrastructure during the pilot project,
							<br/>
							especially since Wordpress was simpler to customize, and none of our pilot projects expressed a preference for one over the other.
							<br/>
							So, to simplify Toolkit development for the pilot, we decided to implement Toolkit sites using Wordpress only.
							<br/>
							It's worth noting that the DSG still supports Omeka for other digital projects, just not yet for Toolkit integration.
							<br/>
							What has been your experience with Wordpress for digital project work?
							<br/>
							Have others experienced issues with supporting Wordpress over time?

						<h2>Pilot Projects</h2>

							At this point we had a roadmap for development, but no projects to develop for.
							<br/>
							The library had already been working with 3 projects that could benefit from the Toolkit, so we decided to include those projects in the pilot.
							<br/>
							Those three projects include:

						<aside class="notes">
							In February we sent out a call for proposals to solicit projects and ideas for tool development from the Northeastern community.
							<br/>
							We received 12 proposals in two months from various university groups and departments, including the Departments of:
							<ul>
								<li>Mechanical and Industrial Engineering,</li>
								<li>Nursing,</li>
								<li>Music,</li>
								<li>Political Science,</li>
								<li>and the School of Criminology of Criminal Justice.</li>
							</ul>
							We selected projects based on whether or not they were feasible, suitable, and sharable.
							<br/>
							We wanted to make sure selected projects had content that either already existed in the DRS or was already digitized and could be ingested into the DRS.
							<br/>
							We wanted to make sure selected projects had the right to distribute the content, and if they did, that the content was appropriate to be ingested in the DRS, and it would be made public.
							<br/>
							And we wanted to make sure that the tools developed for that particular project could be shared with current or future Toolkit projects.
							<br/>
							Based on that criteria we selected three additional projects for the Toolkit pilot:

						<h2>Workflow</h2>
						<img src="images/workflow.jpg" class="stretch" style="border:none"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Once the framework was established and the projects were selected, we got to work preparing the project teams for their sites, which involved several steps:
							<br/>
							We set up an intake interview to learn more about the project work and to answer any questions the project team may have about the process.
							<br/>
							We recommended the project team review their content, with guidance from the universityâ€™s Copyright Officer, if needed.
							<br/>
							If the files were not already in the DRS, we helped the projects prepare their files to be ingested, and create metadata, if necessary.
							<br/>
							We then generated a Wordpress site from the Toolkit template that Eli will describe, and customized it based on basic project specifications.
							<br/>
							We offered training and instruction for project teams throughout the process, though mostly during the file preparation and Wordpress installation stages.
							<br/>
							We will review the site prior to launch to make sure it meets some basic Toolkit requirements.
							<br/>
							And then we will help the project team promote their site.

						<h2><a href="http://liblab.neu.edu/drstest">DRS + Wordpress</a></h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							The toolkit itself is a Wordpress plugin and Wordpress child-theme. We chose Wordpress over Omeka because ultimately we thought the built in features of wordpress would be easier to learn and customize by our users. We would be curious to hear feedback on your thoughts and decisions on Wordpress versus Omeka.

							Our plugin provides templates for three main components of search, browse, and single item view. These templates also enqueue Javascript from the plugin which uses AJAX to reach out to the API, parse the JSON, and present it to users. The plugin provides search, browse, and single item view with extremely minimal Wordpress storage- all Wordpress has in itâ€™s database is the URL for the starting or parent collection in the DRS and some metadata settings. Inputting the collection URL from the DRS associates the collection structure established in the DRS.

							The other functionality that is a focal point for our users is the ability to create exhibits. Here we mean exhibits to be a page or set of pages that contains narrative and objects together with a variety of different layouts and display options such as galleries.
							To achieve this inside Wordpress, we take advantage of some of Wordpress' core functionality and plugins developed by other people. We provide a page builder that allows users to create rows and columns for their content. To pull content dynamically from the DRS, we use a set of custom shortcodes. Wordpress defines shortcodes as "A shortcode is a WordPress-specific code that lets you do nifty things with very little effort. Shortcodes can embed files or create objects that would normally require lots of complicated, ugly code in just one line." The four shortcodes we've developed so far include:

						<aside class="notes">Another major request from our users was the ability to customize the colors and styles of the page. That is why we chose Quest as our parent theme, which provides lots of customization options for coloring and gave us the ability to add our own customization settings - like the one we added for choosing a Northeastern Lockup.</aside>

						<h2>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>

							<li>University Branding</li>

							<ul>
							<li>Introducing project teams to the idea of repository storage with an API connection to Wordpress and managing pilot expectations was difficult.
								<ul><li>We did our best to discuss the scope and timeline of the project and establish roles during the intake interview, but additional discussions and documentation was needed.</li></ul>
							</li>
							<li>Our beta testing revealed that even experienced Wordpress users were hesitant to alter CSS to customize the site.
								<ul><li>We compromised by switching to a similar Wordpress theme with more customizations available in the back end.</li></ul>
							</li>
							<li>Those who were familiar with Wordpress expected more to be done with the media gallery, or expected that DRS content could be customized using tools similar to those available in the media gallery (like resizing images or adding captions).
								<ul><li>We tweaked the Wordpress theme to improve customizations for DRS content, and improved documentation to explain when to use the Toolkit media gallery.</li></ul>
							</li>
							<li>Establishing how university branding should be incorporated into the site was more difficult than expected.
								<ul><li>We eventually met with University Marketing to discuss our branding responsibilities. Their rule was, "If it's hosted on University servers, it needs to include University branding.", so we updated the template theme to include basic University branding.</li></ul>

							As of today the half of the projects have received their Wordpress instances and are currently customizing their sites.
							<br/>
							The other half are still in the file prep and ingestion stages, but should be ready to receive their Toolkit sites by the end of the year.
							<br/>
							In 2016 we will check in with the 2015 Toolkit sites to see how they are doing and what can be improved.
							<br/>
							Weâ€™ll also send out another Call for Proposals to select new projects and generate ideas for new tools to add to the Toolkit.
							<br/>
							Throughout the pilot we identified a few improvements for 2016, including:
							<ul><li>improving integration with content that can't or shouldn't be stored in the DRS, or is already available in another repository, like the DPLA.</li>
							<li>Right now maintenance and updates for the Toolkit sites is done manually by Eli, and we'd like to move to an automated process.</li></ul>
							We've also submitted or are preparing to submit a few grant applications to create Toolkit features that would support full projects into 2017 and beyond
							<ul><li>SHARP: General scholarly workflows, including text analysis and annotations</li>
							<li>Cherokee Narratives: Transcription, translation, and annotations</li>
							<li>NU Law Maps: Integrating map and timeline visualizations with narratives and content into exhibits</li></ul>
