						<h2>DSG: Supporting Digital Scholarship</h2>
						<img class="stretch" src="images/toolkitAlternatives.jpeg"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Digital Scholarship Group (DSG), which is a fairly new department in the library.

							DSG is an applied research group, responsible for researching, developing, and supporting new avenues for digital scholarship at Northeastern.

							A primary goal for the DSG when it was first formed in 2013 was to find a way to support the various projects and research groups that needed to publish digital projects.

							We also wanted to ensure project materials were securely stored and preserved.

							Many of our researchers want a simple, customizable site to share project work, and they often look to Wordpress or Omeka to publish and share their content, neither of which is ideal for long term storage.

							Other projects turn to the library's Digital Repository Service to store and preserve content, which IS ideal for long term storage, but can't be customized for individual project needs.

							Some look to both the DRS for preservation and Wordpress or Omeka for publishing and sharing, duplicating their work across multiple systems.

							We wanted to create a tool that would satisfy the preservation AND presentation needs of a project by joining the DRS with customizable web publishing tools,

							and we wanted to make the tool easily reproducible and sustainable over time. Thus began the development of the DRS Project Toolkit.

							How have you to support project publishing and object storage at your institution?

							Planning for the DRS project toolkit started a year ago in October 2014 as a pilot project.

							We started with a project team of 5, and have expanded to a team of 12 today, including two developers and 4 research assistants.

							At the end of the 2015 pilot, 6 Northeastern projects will be using the Toolkit to present their materials.

						<h2>Goals</h2>
						<img src="images/DRS_Toolkit_Architecture.png" style="width:50%;float:left;"/>
						<ul style="width:40%;float:right;font-size:70%">
							<li>Develop a lightweight and sustainable model for preserving and displaying/distributing project materials.</li>
							<li>Provide Northeastern projects with a low-barrier customized website to share project work.</li>
							<li>Support Northeastern projects by preserving project materials in the DRS.</li>
							<li>Encourage collaborative development between Toolkit sites.</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							In the beginning we had a four goals for the pilot:

							We wanted to create a sustainable and shareable digital project environment for scholars.

							We wanted to start a program that would scale, and we wanted to encourage project teams to become stewards of their own content, and empower them to customize and develop on their own.

							We wanted to avoid providing unique support for individual projects, but work with projects to create customizations that could be utilized by other projects.

							We wanted to create a collaborative environment where project teams could share their own tool development with other Toolkit project teams.

							And we wanted to make sure that the project materials created were stored securely in the DRS, where the library could guarantee materials would be preserved.

							Before I dive into the details, let me give a brief overview of the DRS itself, since it is the foundation of the Toolkit.

							The DRS is a homegrown repository, which uses Fedora as the underlying storage architecture and Hydra for the interface.

							The interface is clean and focused and its main features are designed to support the widest possible range of material.

							There are approximately 76,000 files in the DRS, half of which are openly available to the public.

						<aside class="notes">
							DRS users can
							browse through nested communities and collections,
							perform basic keyword searching across the full site,
							or scope their search to a particular community or collection of files.

							Search results and browse pages allow users to refine results using facets, including limits for creator, year, subject, and type, and sorting options for title, creator, or recently added.

							Users can also change the number of results on the page, or display items in a list view or a grid view.

							These are the features we hoped to take advantage of using the Hydra API.

						<h2>Stakeholder Input</h2>
						<h4>Suggested Features</h4>
						<ul style="font-size:50%;">
							<li>Faceted full text search</li>
							<li>Visualizations, particularly maps and timelines</li>
							<li>Downloads</li>
							<li>Sharing, including citations, social media, and object embedding</li>
							<li>Easily interpreted data feed (i.e. JSON, CSV, RDF, XML)</li>
							<li>Credit pages for project creators and curators</li>
							<li>Metrics</li>
							<li>Exhibits and/or galleries</li>
							<li>Support for objects that are not stored in the DRS</li>
							<li>Two-way syncing data between the web publishing tool and the DRS</li>
							<li>Annotations</li>
							<li>XML-aware search</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Before we started work on the Hydra API that would feed DRS data to the Toolkit sites, we wanted to know precisely what functionality was needed to make a good digital project site.
							We met in December with representatives from a few DSG projects and partners, including Our Marathon, the Early Caribbean Digital Archive, University Archives and Special collections, as well as with students from public history who work a lot with digital project publishing. We discussed what they, as digital scholars, need from an integrated digital publishing site like the one we were about to develop. We identified a few common needs from the group, including faceted searching, visualizations, sharing, downloading, and galleries or exhibits.
							A few features were suggested during this meeting that were worth exploring in the future, but were out of scope for the pilot project, including two-way data syncing between the publishing tool and the DRS, the ability to annotate files, and XML-aware searching.
							We synthesized the outcomes of the stakeholder meeting into a list of features, which would become the first set of tools in the Toolkit, and our discussion helped inform our decisions about the Toolkit spec and project workflows.

						<h2>Feature Set</h2>
						<div style="width:45%;display:inline-block;float:left">
							<h4>API</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Search targeted DRS content</li>
								<li>Browse targeted DRS content</li>
								<li>Refine search and browse results using facets</li>

							</ul>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							I'll let Eli describe the API in more detail, but at this point we knew that, in order to support the Toolkit features, the API would need to enable browsing and keyword searching of targeted DRS content; filtering of result using facets; sorting of results; and displaying two different metadata levels, a brief display for browse and search results, and a full metadata display for item pages.
							We also needed to decide what web publishing tools we were willing to support for the Toolkit.
							We originally planned on supporting Drupal, Omeka, and Wordpress, but quickly decided that Drupal would be too cumbersome. Omeka is very popular with digital scholars but we realized that there were few advantages to supporting both Omeka and Wordpress during the pilot project, especially since none of our inaugural projects expressed a preference for one over the other. So, to simplify Toolkit development for the pilot, we decided to implement Toolkit sites using Wordpress only.

						<h2>Pilot Projects</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							At this point we had a roadmap for development, but no projects to develop for. The library had already been working with 3 projects that could benefit from a customized display for DRS content, so we decided to include those projects in the pilot. Those projects include:
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>"Picturing the World" Gallery, Graham Arader <small>University Libraries</small></h3>
						<p>Tools need: Exhibit</p>
						<img src="images/arader_avian.png" class="stretch"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							The Libraryâ€™s "Picturing the World" gallery is a collection of maps, watercolors, and Audubon prints donated to the library by Graham Arader. There are 118 high resolution TIFFs, already in the DRS, and all fully cataloged.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Catskills Institute, Professor Phil Brown <small>Department of Sociology and Anthropology</small></h3>
						<p>Tools need: Exhibit, Multipage Support</p>
						<img src="images/catskills.jpg" class="stretch"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Phil Brown's Catskills Institute is a collection of images, postcards, programs, and other artifacts of the thriving Jewish communities in Catskill Mountains. Since this collection contains a lot of multipage objects (postcards with front and back scans, brochures, etc), it gave us the opportunity to develop support for files with ordinal values in the DRS.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Interviews with Jewish Latin American Writers and Artists, Professor Stephen A. Sadow <small>Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures</small></h3>
						<p>Tools need: A/V Playlist</p>
						<img src="images/sadow.png" class="stretch"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Stephen Sadowâ€™s interviews with Latin American Writers and Artists is a series of 12 video interviews recorded in Argentina by Sadow himself in 2012. All of these materials are stored together in the DRS, but Sadow was interested creating a presentation version for his users.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Call for Proposals</h3>
						<ul style="width:40%;float:left;">
							<li>Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</li>
							<li>Department of Nursing</li>

						</ul>
						<img src="images/DRSplus_RF.jpeg" style="width:50%;float:right;"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Since the pilot was also a test of the usefulness of the Toolkit as a digital support framework for the general Northeastern community, we wanted to include a few other Northeastern projects in the pilot. In February we sent out a call for proposals to solicit projects from the University community. We received 12 proposals in two months from various university groups and departments, including the Departments of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Nursing, Music, Political Science, and the School of Criminology of Criminal Justice.
							We selected projects based on whether or not they were feasible, suitable, and sharable.
							To satisfy the feasibility requirement, we wanted to make sure selected projects had content that either already existed in the DRS or was already digitized and could be ingested into the DRS.
							To satisfy the suitability requirement, we wanted to make sure selected projects had the right to distribute the content, and if they did, were appropriate to be ingested in the DRS. Also, we only wanted to work with content that could be made publicly available.
							To satisfy the share-ability requirement, we wanted to make sure that the features developed for that particular project could be shared with current or future Toolkit projects.

						<h3>Boston Public Schools Desegregation Collection <small>University Archives and Special Collections</small></h3>
						<p>Tools need: Exhibit, A/V Playlist, Geographic and Timeline Visualizations</p>
						<img src="images/desegregation.png" class="stretch"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							University Archives and Special Collections proposed an exhibit to display DRS content related to the history of the desegregation of Boston Public Schools in the 1970's. This proposal was selected because the content was already available in the DRS (though cataloging is still ongoing) and because it had the potential to require development of multiple tools, including exhibits, audio and video displays and playlists, timeline and geographic visualizations, and narrative pages.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Student Work Showcase, Digital Media Commons Studios <small>University Libraries</small></h3>
						<p>Tools need: Exhibit, A/V Playlist</p>
						<img src="images/dmcstudios.jpeg" class="stretch"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Digital Media Commons Studios proposed a showcase of student created work produced using the state-of-the-art audio and visual recording tools in the DMC Studios. This proposal was selected because it is a small, easily ingested collection, that requires support for many different content types.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Holocaust Awareness Week Programming, Holocaust Awareness Committee <small>College of Social Sciences and Humanities</small></h3>
						<p>Tools need: Exhibit, A/V Playlist, Timeline Visualization</p>
						<img src="images/hac.png" class="stretch"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							The Holocaust Awareness Committee proposed an archive of the recordings of Northeasternâ€™s Holocaust Awareness Week program, which is an annual event that includes lectures, survivor testimonies, and featured speakers. This proposal was selected because the content was already cataloged by the library (though the films did need some re-digitization), and would require video support and a timeline visualization.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Workflow</h2>
						<img src="images/workflow.jpg" class="stretch" style="border:none"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Once the framework was established and the projects were selected, we got to work preparing the project teams for their sites, which involved several steps:
							An intake interview is required to learn more about the project work, to answer any questions the project team have about the process, to discuss the timeline of the work, and to clarify responsibilities for the DSG and the project team.
							We recommend the project team review their content, with guidance from the universityâ€™s Copyright Officer, if needed.
							If the files are not already in the DRS, we help the projects prepare their files to be ingested, and create metadata, if necessary.
							When the files and project team are ready, a Wordpress site is generated from the Toolkit template, customized based on basic project specifications (including their own URL, branding requirements, etc), and issued to designated project team member, who became the site administrator.
							We offer training and instruction for project teams throughout the process, though mostly during the file preparation and Wordpress installation stages. Documentation was critical, not just to help the project teams work with the Toolkit and display their files, but for us as well as we designed the process.
							When a project team is ready to launch their site, we review the site to make sure it meets some basic Toolkit requirements. We check to make sure the site includes the required University branding elements, that a credits page is included for the project team, that the DSG and Toolkit are acknowledged, and we make sure that changes have not been made that might prevent the DSG from performing basic site maintenance.
							Once the site is ready for the public, we help the project team promote their site.

						<h2>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Managing Expectations</li>
							<li>CSS Customizations</li>
							<li>Wordpress Media Gallery</li>
							<li>University Branding</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Introducing project teams to the idea of repository storage with an API connection to Wordpress and managing pilot expectations was difficult. We did our best to discuss the scope and timeline of the project and establish roles during the intake interview meetings held with project teams, but additional discussions and documentation was needed. We prepared a document describing the goals and outcomes of the Toolkit pilot, as well as an architectural diagram, and made a better effort to communicate with project teams about the goals and timeline of the project.

							Our beta testing revealed that even experienced Wordpress users were hesitant to alter CSS to customize the Wordpress site. We compromised by switching to a similar Wordpress theme with more customizations available in the Wordpress backend to allow project teams to avoid the CSS file for most customizations.

							Those who were familiar with Wordpress expected more to be done with the media gallery, or expected that DRS content could be customized using tools similar to those available in the media gallery (like resizing images or adding captions). We tweaked the Wordpress theme to improve customizations for DRS content, and improved documentation to explain when to use the Toolkit media gallery.

							Establishing how university branding should be incorporated into the site was more difficult than expected. We eventually met with University Marketing to discuss our branding responsibilities. Their rule was, "If it's hosted on University servers, it needs to include University branding." We updated the template theme to include basic University branding, and informed the project representatives that they would need to contact Marketing if they wanted to customize or remove the prescribed branding.

							As of today the Library's Graham Arader "Picturing the World" Gallery, University Archives collections, and Sadow's Jewish Latin American Writers and Artists project teams have all received their Wordpress instances and are currently customizing their sites. Catskills, DMC Studios, and the Holocaust Awareness Committee projects are still in the file prep and ingestion stages, but should be ready to receive their Toolkit sites by the end of the year.

							In 2016 we will check in with the 2015 Toolkit sites to see how they are doing and what can be improved. Weâ€™ll also send out another Call for Proposals to select new projects and generate ideas for new tools to add to the Toolkit.

							Throughout the pilot we identified a few improvements for 2016, including improving integration with content that can't or shouldn't be stored in the DRS, or is already available in another repository, like the DPLA. We'd also like to use the DRS Sets feature so project teams can select content from various DRS collections, and we want to allow project teams to customize the full metadata display for their items. Right now maintenance and updates for the Toolkit sites is done manually by Eli, and we'd like to move to an automated process.

							And finally, if our grant proposal is funded, we will add support for XML aware searching, particularly for TEI and for annotating content.
